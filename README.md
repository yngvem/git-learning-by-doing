# Git: Learning by doing

This is a small series of exercises to learn a good Git workflow.
The tutorial assumes that you have a basic understanding of what Git and GitHub/GitLab/etc are, but want to move on to getting a good Git workflow.
You should be familiar with how to clone a repository from GitHub, push your changes and make commits.
It is focused on learning-by-doing and include exercises for Python, but you can easily change it by using your programming language of choice instead.

The first topic you'll learn about is [forking](text/01-fork.md).

## Cloning your repository

When you forked this repository, you got a copy of it on your GitHub profile that you can change as you like.
However, you still need to download the code to make changes to it.
To do this, you should clone your fork of this repository.

Once you've cloned the repo, you should open it in your IDE of choice (e.g. VSCode).
To double check that you cloned the fork and not the parent repo, you can run `git remote -v` and check that the correct remote is used (i.e. your username is in the remote URLs).

Once you've cloned the repository, you're ready for [Branching](03-branching.md)

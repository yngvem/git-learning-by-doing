## Forking

When you are working on a repo that you don't own, you typically [*fork*](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo) it.
Forking essentially means that you make a copy of the repository (repo) that you become the owner of.
You can then make any changes to that repo and submitt a pull request (PR), also known as merge request (MR) on GitLab to ask the owner of the parent repository to incorporate your changes into their code.

You can start by forking this repository by pressing the "Fork" button to the right of the repo name.
Keep the default name and description of the repository.

You can now move on to [cloning your fork](02-cloning.md)
